      <h3>About the Project</h3>
      <p>The Vision of the AC Study Group Training Module is to offer students a formula for forming a successful study group with the goal of improving student learning and success. Studying with peers is one of the most effective ways to learn and process course material and concepts. With the AC Study Group Training Module, a group of peers can collaboratively work together toward a common goal. </p>
      <p>This project was supported by the Algonquin College Innovation Fund (ACIF) and the Office of Applied Research and Innovation (ARI).</p>
      <p>The  purpose of the Algonquin College Innovation Fund (formerly known as the Faculty Innovation Fund) is to encourage innovation within Algonquin College by funding new projects that will lead to productivity improvements, enhanced teaching and learning, scholarly activity, contributions to fields of knowledge, more engaged employees and student success. It is intended that the ACIF will be operated as a grant program to which proposals may be submitted.</p>
      <p>Applied Research is focused on applying the latest knowledge and technologies in the creation of useful products/services, pro-grams, and processes. It is both different and complimentary to basic research, which is primarily focused on the discovery of new academic knowledge through the investigation and proof of new theories and principles.</p>
      <p>The Office of Applied Research and Innovation (ARI) at the Waterfront Campus creates partnerships with local community enter-prises, industry, and organizations to foster innovation. We match our colleges resources—students, faculty, and infrastructure—with community partners to help solve problems. Students are involved in the innovation process.; they receive real world experience and develop valuable skill sets. Community partners have access to the resources required to test or launch a product/service or to address community challenges.</p>
